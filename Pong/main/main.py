Tutorial 1: An introduction to pygame - The Basics
In this tutorial we will just be getting pygame up and running.  
Our goal is a small template that produces a blank window that 
doesnâ€™t hang that we can close with the window X or by pressing 
escape.  Additionally we want to put our frames per second in 
the title bar, just for good measure.
